# Ai-shopping-extension
Chrome extension using GPT to give shopping advice


This is an old project.
It served as a proof of concept and test for a product which has been overshadowed by better alternatives on the market. 
Furthermore, it served as a place where I could learn a bit about solving website problems and problems in JS.

The Server is the AI part to generates the descriptions and texts for each product
The database is simply the database supporting the whole project
And the extension is the Google Chrome extension which uses the other parts

The extension talks to the server through the domain allowed in the manifest file, the server is running a Fastapi server or Flask server I believe. 

Further upgrades would be to write better HTML, CSS, and JS for more dynamic and uniform results and display. 
upgrading to GPT 3.5 or GPT 4 to generate descriptions
upgrading and sliming down the server and databasing code.
